# Idea for this branch

The main idea for this branch is to use an ellipsoid on polygon obstacle avoidance constraint, the constraint was presented in the following paper [Efficient Collision Modelling for Numerical Optimal Control](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10178210). 

As done before we will get the closest plane and represent the plane as a ultra thin cube, with the faces being close so the plane
